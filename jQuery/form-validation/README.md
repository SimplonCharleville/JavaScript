# jQuery validation form
### You must not modify the HTML and CSS files.

Starting from the page "form.html", develop the form validation with jQuery.<br>
Put your code in js/scripts.js (you will use the included function validateEmail() to validate the e-mail fields).

The fieldset "Your colleague subscription" is hidden by default. By clicking on the checkbox "Subscribe another company member", it appears and the fields inside must also be treated by your function.

If required fields are empty/invalid, apply them a class "error". For checkboxes and radio buttons, apply this class to the previous div.
Delete this class once they are filled.
